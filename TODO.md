### Todo

Priority #1:
- global event handling
- only update pintar buffers on changes

- scale ui by window resolution
- cleaner error handling (wip)
- replace static mut refs with mutexes or some shit !
- get some cool screenshots for the github
- move paths between collections (copy aswell?)
- move collections
- save timer position
- popup messages
- fix all the bugs :)

### Suggested Features / Changes

- Hacking Timer (Percy)
- Rename Collections on create (Icarus)
- Raise Config Tab min size (Icarus)

### Planned Features

- culling
- limit drawn lines per collection by only drawing first 10 and then every Nth so that 10+M/N = MAX
- double buffered recording so the filled buffer can be saved to disk and discarded when other gets full
- section triggers (wip)
- use ingame triggers
