If you have an idea for a feature please feel free to message me on discord!\
I'm also happy to receive pull requests :)

# Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Hellbufl/celestial/releases)

# Supported Files
| Game          | Working Proxies                           |
| ---           | ---                                       |

# Usage
- Toggle the menu with the default keybind `HOME` (look up the other keybinds in the Config tab)
-->

### Comparisons (default)
- Create a Path Collection with the + button
- Activate collections with their record button
- Place a start and an end trigger
- Start recording a path by leaving the start trigger and finish by entering the end trigger
- The finished path will be added to all active collections
- Highlight a path by clicking on the time
- Use the buttons labeled "M" ("Mute") and "S" ("Solo") to hide / only show the selected path

After multiple recordings with the same set of triggers, the different paths will be sorted from fastest to slowest within their collection and colored on a gradient (default: green -> red) with the fastest being highlighted (default: gold).

### Separate Paths
- Activate "Direct Mode" in the Config tab
- The "Create Trigger" keybinds now directly start and end the recording respectively
